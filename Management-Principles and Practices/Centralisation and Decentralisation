What are the differences between centralisation and
decentralisation?

To fully grasp the concept of centralised and decentralised entities, you must analyse them on level terms. To keep it simple, we have tabulated these elements of comparison.

Comparison Basis

Information flow

Decentralisation--Free flow in perfect conditions

Centralisation--Tends to be vertical and top-heavy

Meant for

Decentralisation--Ideal for extremely large entities including PSUs

Centralisation--Ideal for smaller companies with smaller workforces

Speed of decision-making

Decentralisation--Faster than centrally planned and organise companies & even economies

Centralisation--Tends to be slower

Number of people involved

Decentralisation--Has a larger body of managers and decision makers, a prime character to settle the centralisation vs decentralisation debate.

Centralisation--Fewer people involved in hands-on decision making

Stability

Decentralisation--May tend to be unstable due to conflicts in personality and approach to business

Centralisation--Conformity is maintained as decision-making is confined to a select few

Employee motivation

Decentralisation--Employees in decentralised operations tend to have better morale in theory. In real-life, that may not always be so

Centralisation--Motivation levels may appear deceptively low since employees may feel they have been ‘burdened’ with decisions

Day to day operations and burden-sharing

Decentralisation--Decentralised entities tend to have better sharing of responsibility. This is a possible settlement to the debate on centralisation and decentralisation in management

Centralisation--One select group carries the burden, risks and responsibilities
