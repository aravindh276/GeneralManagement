What is profit volume ratio?
Profit-Volume Ratio (PA/Ratio): Meaning and Uses (With Formula)
Let us make an in-depth study of the meaning and uses of profit-volume ratio.

Meaning:

Profit-volume ratio indicates the relationship between contribution and sales and is usually expressed in percentage.

The ratio shows the amount of contribution per rupee of sales. Since, in the short-term, fixed cost does not change, the profit-volume ratio also measures the rate of change of profit due to change in the volume of sales.

It is influenced by sales and variable or marginal cost. If the sale price increases without a corresponding increase in marginal cost, the contribution increases—and the profit-volume ratio improves. Similarly, if the marginal cost is reduced with sale price remaining same— profit-volume ratio improves.

The advantages of profit-volume ratio are that it can be used to measure profitability of each product, or group of them, separately so that the necessity for continuance of such production can be examined. It may also be used to measure the profitability of each production centre, process or operation.

One fundamental property of profit-volume ratio is that it remains same at various levels of operation and, thus, break-even point; required selling prices to maintain profits at various levels etc. can be easily calculated by suitable application of this ratio.

The formula to calculate P/V ratio is:

P/V ratio = Contribution/Sales = Change in Contribution/Change in sales = Change of profit/Change in Sales

A high P/V ratio indicates high profitability so that a slight increase in volume, without increase in fixed cost, would result in high profits. A low P/V ratio, on the other hand, is a sign of low profitability so that efforts should be made to improve P/V ratio.

Uses of P/V Ratio:

(i) It helps in the determination of Break-even-point [BEP = Fixed cost ÷ P/V ratio]

(ii) It helps in the determination of profit at any volume of sales

[Sales x P/V ratio = Contribution, Profit = Contribution – Fixed Cost]

(iii) It helps in the determination of sales to earn a desired amount of profit

(v)It helps in determining the variable cost for any volume of Sales
[Variable Cost=Sales*(1-P/V ratio)]
(vi) It helps in determining margin of safety [Margin of safety = Profit ÷ P/V ratio]
