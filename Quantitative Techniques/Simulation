What is meant by Simulation?

Simulation is normally used to assess the current, or predict the future, performance of a business process. The concept is designed to help practitioners and business owners discover new ways to improve their business processes through the use of mathematical, statistical and other analytical methods.

Simulation Definition

Simulation typically uses statistical and computer modelling to investigate the performance of a business process either for a new situation or to improve an existing set of processes. By modelling different process scenarios and outcomes, companies can minimise the traditional risks associated with change management initiatives without having to make changes in a 'live' business environment where performance could adversely be affected (Harrington and Tumay, 2000).

Business Simulation
Definition: Business Simulation is the imitation of the operations and management of a real-world business process, system, organization, competing firms or an entire supply chain over time.
The quality of the underlying model representing the key characteristics of the complex 'real world' is crucial.
BS is used mainly for educational and team development purposes, typically practicing strategic, financial, market or operational analysis, logical and creative thinking, and decision making while at the same time working on personal skills (e.g., collaborating, negotiating), team building, management and leadership development.Also called Simulation Game, Business Game and Management Game.
