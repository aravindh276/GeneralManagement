Define â€œNo Passing Rule" in a sequencing problem.

This means that the passing is not allowed , i.e.,the same order of jobs is maintained over each machine. If n jobs are to be processed through the two machines A and B in the order AB,then this means that each job will go to machine  A first then to B.

Types of Job Sequencing Problem
Various types of job sequencing problem arise in the world. All sequencing problems
cannot be solved. Here, we consider the following four types of job sequencing problem:
I. n jobs are to be processed on 2 machines, say, machine A and machine B in the
order AB. This means that each job is to be processed first on machine A and
then on machine B.
II. n jobs are to be processed on 3 machines A, B and C in the order ABC, i.e., first
on machine A, second on machine B and third on machine C.
III. n jobs are to be processed on m machines in the given order
IV. 2 jobs are to be processed on m machines in the given order.
